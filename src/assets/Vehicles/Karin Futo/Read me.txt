Thank you so much for downloading my mods!

To install this one, simply drag the "Futo" folder to your modloader folder (strongly recomended) or just import the files manually into GTA3.img

(In fact, you don´t even need previon.txd since it uses the original one, but I added it for if you want to install it as another car)

And there you go! Have fun :)

I also recomend to have VehFuncs installed, so you get a working steering wheel and engine animations, but it´s not necessary for the mod to work.

Hope you like this mod, and if you do, check out my Youtube channel for more stuff like this :)
