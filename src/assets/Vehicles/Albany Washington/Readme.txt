NOTICES:
- If you plan to release one of my mods in your website or another website I'm fine with it, but please include my name and this readme in the mod !
- If you saw one of my mods please report ! I'd apreciate it.
- If you found a glitch, problem with one of my mods or you have an idea or opinion about the mods, feel free to send me a pm in Gtaforums.
- You need to rebuild archive ONLY when you add a file in the .img, so no need to rebuild it when you replace.
- You can open .cfg .dat .ide with the notepad.
- This mod is NOT perfect.
- I added the reflection textures in the .txd this time so that you could edit it or remove it if that reflection bothers you.
- The mod includes 2Txds, LQ (Low quality) and BQ (Better quality).
- If you use Xbox or a slow computer it is recommended to use the LQ textures.

TOOLS USED:
- Zmodeler
- Txd workshop
- Handling editor
- Img tool

TESTED ON: Xbox and PC

Have fun!
