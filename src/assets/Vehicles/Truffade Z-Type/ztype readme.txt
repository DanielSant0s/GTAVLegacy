1937 Truffade Z-Type (an conversion from GTA 5) by QuanAnhGaming x TechnoPH + ssolar

Used to be owned by Zaibatsu Cooperation, but now sold for SA during the last Great Depression in 1937, minorities and women knew their place. Known for the fastest automobiles, the most expensive car, Z-Type is a car you can
really enjoy sitting in, surrounded by armed guards, too terrified to actually drive it anywhere! Only limited sold so quickly get your own car at Las Venturas for over $10,345,000

=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

A total conversion from GTA 5's Truffade Z-Type (based on 1937 Bugatti Type 57SC "Atlantic") now arrived to San Andreas! Fully SA Styled and fits the atmosphere, if not the 30s classic vehicles ofc...

        - Owned the same col, chassis_vlo from helomyname's 29 Special but got some edit parts, but LOD and Shadow are not
		- 3 spinnable triangles on the wheel
		- gas trunk behind the license plate
		- full datas can be seen down there
		- can be added or replace Hustler
