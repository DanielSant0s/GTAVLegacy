		1) Install ModLoader.
		2) Install F92 Limit Adjuster (you can place it inside its own folder in ModLoader if you want).
		3) Extract modloader folder into you Game Directory.
		4) Add this line into your gtasa_vehicleAudioSettings.cfg file:

			peyote                                    0             17     16     0         0.85         1.0          5         0.943874     1           0          6          0           45                0.0

		6) Don't forget to change the "ID" in the 'vehicles.ide' part of the add.txt file to a Free ID Slot
			*I recommend downloading "Free ID Generator" by fastman92 to determine what ID you can use

		7) Insert ", peyote" in any of the categories in your cargrp.dat.
		8) Find the car on the streets. Enjoy.

	For AutoID3000 Version:

		3) Extract the files inside "AutoID Files" inside "Vapid Peyote (SA)" Folder. Replace All where necessary.

			*When installing Tuning Parts, don't forget to delete loader_peyote.txt.

		4) AutoID will take care of the rest. Enjoy your new ride.
