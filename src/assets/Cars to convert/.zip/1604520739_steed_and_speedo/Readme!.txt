		*HIGHLY Recommended to read this thread to understand how it works: https://gtaforums.com/topic/832297-satut-how-to-add-new-cars-without-replacing/

		1) Install ModLoader.
		2) Install F92 Limit Adjuster (you can place it inside its own folder in ModLoader if you want).
		3) Extract modloader folder into you Game Directory.
		4) Don't forget to change the "ID" in the 'vehicles.ide' part of the add.txt file to a Free ID Slot
			*I recommend downloading "Free ID Generator" by fastman92 to determine what ID you can use
                5) Insert the vehicle filename in any of the categories in your cargrp.dat (Optional)
		6) Run The Game, Spawn it or Find the car on the streets. Enjoy.
